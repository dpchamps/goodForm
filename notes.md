I think it's helpful to take notes of what I'm learning while I'm writing these libraries. Especially now 
that I have two screens. 

#Document.createRange

##The Range object

An interface that represents a fragment of a given document. 
   
Can be created using `createRange` method, located in document.

Can be created using the `Range()` constructor.
